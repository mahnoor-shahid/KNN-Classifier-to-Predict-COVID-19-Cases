# KNN Classifier to predict COVID-19 Cases

This project uses **Jupyter Notebook** to create a model for predicting whether or not the targeted cases are of COVID-19 or not.

# Objective

> To develop a model using KNN Classification Algorithm using the optimized parameters and the required dataset which is explored, cleaned and visualized using various techniques. 

# Prerequisites
 - Python Intermediate
 - Machine Learning Basics
